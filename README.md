	This website is intended for people who are looking for something new to watch so they want to browse through anime ranking in a specific genre. Users could also browse top fights, top villains, and other ranking with different characteristics. The website will integrate different kinds of more specific rankings in one place, without having the users search for them around the web. The interface will also provide an English, Russian, Korean and Chinese versions of the website. We will make a modern and better looking web interface, which we found to be a problem among all the already existing services. 

	We are thinking of getting our resources from a currently existing website www.myanimelist.com and use the API they provide in order to get anime information on the page.
